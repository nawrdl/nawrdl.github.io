    title: "How to use landing page blocks"
    content: |
      Create a page with `layout: landing-page`, then add a `hero` and the ordered `blocks` the page needs.

      Each item in `blocks` needs a `type`: `achievements`, `carousel`, `standard`, `page-cards`, `partner-logos`, `split-hero`, or `background-hero`. The blocks render in the order they appear in the YAML `blocks` list, from top to bottom.

      Every landing block accepts `background: "primary"` or `"secondary"`. Omit it for the normal page background. The `standard` type handles text, images, actions, and cards on any of these backgrounds.

      The only block most landing pages should always have is `hero`. Everything in `blocks` is optional and can be added or reordered as the project grows.
  - type: "achievements"
    background: "secondary"
    eyebrow: "achievements"
    title: "Achievements block"
    lead: "Use achievements for project metrics, major outputs, milestones, or key facts. `eyebrow`, `lead`, and `separator` are optional. Each item can use a `value`, an `icon`, or an `image`."
    items:
      - value: "24"
        label: "Research outputs"
        text: "Use `value` for numbers, dates, or short high-impact facts."
      - icon: "A"
        label: "Advisory groups"
        text: "Use `icon` for a compact letter, symbol, or short visual marker."

        image_alt: "Green turtle"
        label: "Field sites"

  - type: "carousel"
    eyebrow: "carousel"
    title: "Carousel block"
    lead: "Use the carousel for fieldwork, project locations, lab work, community activities, or visual summaries. The carousel `eyebrow`, `title`, `lead`, `separator`, and slide `caption` fields are optional."

      This is the default landing section style. Use it for ordinary explanatory content.

      Required: `type: "standard"` and `title`.

      Optional: `id`, `eyebrow`, `content`, `link_text`, `link_url`, `actions`, `image`, `image_alt`, `image_position`, `cards`, `background`, and `separator`.

      Add `image` to place media beside the text. The image sits on the right by default.

      Optional: set `image_position: "left"` to reverse the layout.
  - type: "standard"

      Use `type: "standard"` with `background: "secondary"` for a full-width background band. It uses `secondary_color` from `_config.yml`.

      Good for project summaries, research focus areas, or sections that need gentle emphasis.
  - type: "standard"
    background: "primary"
    title: "Standard block on primary background"
    eyebrow: "standard"
    content: |
      Use `type: "standard"` with `background: "primary"` for a strong full-width band using `primary_color`.

      Good for impacts, calls to action, key findings, or short statements that should stand apart.

    eyebrow: "standard"
    content: |
      Add up to two optional `actions` to any landing section. The first action uses the primary colour and the second uses the surface colour.
    actions:

    folder: "sample-content/animals/"
    columns: 3
    link_text: "Read species profile"
    background: "secondary"
    separator: true
    content: |
      These cards are collected from the animals folder and displayed in page order. The secondary background fills the browser width, while each card uses the configured surface colours.
  - type: "page-cards"
    eyebrow: "page-cards"
    title: "Page cards block, one per row"
    folder: "sample-content/animals/"

  - type: "standard"
    eyebrow: "standard"
    background: "primary"
    title: "Table on primary background"
    content: |
      The table uses the primary background and matching text colours. Light backgrounds receive subtle alternating row stripes; dark backgrounds remain unshaded. Borders separate the rows.

      | Activity | Habitat | Purpose |
      | --- | --- | --- |
      | Wildlife survey | Rainforest | Record species observations. |
      | Water sampling | Estuary | Monitor water quality. |
      | Nest monitoring | Coast | Track nesting success. |
      | Habitat mapping | Reef | Identify important habitat areas. |
  - type: standard
    eyebrow: "standard"
    title: "Table on standard background"
    content: |
      No background colour is specified for this block. The table body uses the standard page background and matching text colours, with subtle alternating stripes when that background is light.

      | Activity | Habitat | Purpose |
      | --- | --- | --- |
      | Wildlife survey | Rainforest | Record species observations. |
      | Water sampling | Estuary | Monitor water quality. |
      | Nest monitoring | Coast | Track nesting success. |
      | Habitat mapping | Reef | Identify important habitat areas. |
  - type: "partner-logos"
    background: "primary"
    columns: 2
    eyebrow: "partner-logos"
    title: "Partner logos with background: primary"
    content: |
      White reverse mono logos have transparent backgrounds, so the primary colour shows through their negative spaces.

      Use `type: "partner-logos"` for funders, collaborators, institutions, and participating groups. The title is optional. Place the block wherever it belongs in `blocks`.
    items:
      - name: "Partner organisation"

    title: "Partners on a secondary background"
    content: |

        logo: "/assets/sample-images/partner-placeholder.svg"
